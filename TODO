TODO
====
- Exit application on BACK key.
- Ability to redefine a function. Easiest way: when input line is 'f(' and user presses clear, only delete '(' not whole line.
- When navigating to a history entry and executing it again, without first changing it, move it on top of the history instead of creating a new history entry.
- Context-sensitive KeyState menus which only display those operations which are currently valid.
- Optionally rotate the plot by 90 degrees (so the user has to rotate their phone), yielding a landscape orientation which may be better suited to many plots. 
- Anti-aliasing of the plotted curve to make it look smoother.
- Make the plot screen interactive: user can move around and zoom (both plot() and map()).
- Differentiate, integrate, find extrema, find zeros (numerically).
- Symbolic differentiation.

- Add unit tests, get good test coverage.
- Fix bugs with function re-definition.
- Support pointer for pushing buttons (for touch-screen mobile phones).
- Improve usability (how?).
- Support different key layouts (e.g. for Nokia E61).

- Improve web page.
- Setup mailing list.
- Declare open-source status on web page, link to svn & mailing list.

DONE
====
- Optionally leaving out the * for multiplication.
- Only plot when the user presses the fire button.
- A two-dimensional plotter, for functions with two parameters, that maps function values to colour or grayscale values. Perhaps call it map().
- map() plot should indicate values corresponding to white and black.
- Rewrite Expr and Symbol to use a stack-based "virtual machine" - the speed gain should be useful especially for map().
- plot() should accept a general expression involving x as its first parameter. Similar for map().
- Allow expressions like '1+1)*(2+2'

IDEAS
=====
- Dimensions, unit conversion (300m/s -> km/h; sin(60deg); 100ft^2 -> m^2).
- Contextual help for functions.
- Allow custom function and parameter names (how?) (e.g.: BMI(weight, height) := weight/height^2). 
- Additional, optional function packages.
