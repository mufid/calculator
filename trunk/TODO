- Optionally leaving out the * for multiplication.
- Only plot when the user presses the fire button.
- When navigating to a history entry and executing it again, without first changing it, move it on top of the history instead of creating a new history entry.
- Context-sensitive KeyState menus which only display those operations which are currently valid.
- plot() should accept a general expression involving x as its first parameter.
- Anti-aliasing of the plotted curve to make it look smoother.
- A two-dimensional plotter, for functions with two parameters, that maps function values to colour or grayscale values. Perhaps call it map().
- Rewrite Expr and Symbol to use a stack-based "virtual machine" - the speed gain should be useful especially for map().
- Make the plot screen interactive: user can move around and zoom (both plot() and map()).
