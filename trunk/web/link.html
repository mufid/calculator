You may use screen-shot images from this site when writing about Javia Calculator, 
but please <strong>do not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotlink">hotlink</a></strong> 
to the images on this site; instead, download the images and host them on your server.
</p>

<p>
The preferred way to refer to Javia Calculator is to use this link:
<a href="http://calculator.javia.org/">http://calculator.javia.org/</a>, and the name Javia Calculator.
</p>

<p>
If you want to link directly to the downloadable .jar, please use this link:
<a href="http://calculator.javia.org/Javia-Calculator.jar">http://calculator.javia.org/Javia-Calculator.jar</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please <strong>do not host the .jar on your server</strong> 
(this would mean that you are re-distributing the Javia Calculator, 
and you are not allowed to do this without permission). 

Instead, link to the .jar on this website 
<a href="http://calculator.javia.org/Javia-Calculator.jar">http://calculator.javia.org/Javia-Calculator.jar</a>.
</p>

<p>
You should avoid to link to a specific version 
(such as http://calculator.javia.org/Javia-Calculator-0.1.0.jar). 
Instead, link to http://calculator.javia.org/Javia-Calculator.jar, which redirects to
the most recent version available.
</p>

<p>
You are not allowed to re-distribute Javia Calculator 
(in particular, you are not allowed to host the Javia Calculator binaries on any website
and offer them for download) without permission from Mihai Preda, the copyright holder.
